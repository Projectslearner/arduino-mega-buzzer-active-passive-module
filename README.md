# Buzzer Active Passive Module

#### Project Overview

The "Buzzer Active Passive Module" project focuses on using an active buzzer with an Arduino Mega. This project demonstrates how to control the buzzer to produce sound by generating digital signals. The active buzzer emits sound when a high signal is applied to it, and stops emitting sound when the signal is low.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Active Buzzer**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Buzzer to Arduino Mega:**
   - Connect the positive (longer) leg of the buzzer to digital pin 2.
   - Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the buzzer to ground (GND).

#### Instructions

1. **Code Setup:**
   - Open Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

2. **Upload Code:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - The buzzer will produce a sound in intervals of 1 second (on/off).

#### Applications

- **Auditory Feedback:** Provide audio signals for alerts or notifications.
- **Alarm Systems:** Integrate with alarm systems for sound alerts.
- **Interactive Projects:** Enhance user interaction with audible feedback.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct polarity when connecting the buzzer to prevent damage.
- Adjust delay timings in the code to modify sound duration and frequency.
- Experiment with different tones and frequencies by varying the delay intervals.
- Consider adding a transistor or driver circuit for higher current requirements of the buzzer.
